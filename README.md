# Automated Invoicing ROI Calculator

Project Overview

The Automated Invoicing ROI Calculator is a lightweight web application that allows businesses to simulate cost savings, payback period, and ROI when switching from manual invoice processing to automated invoicing.

The tool is built using Python and Streamlit and includes scenario management, email-gated PDF reports, and bias-favored outputs to demonstrate the financial benefits of automation.

Features

Quick Simulation: Enter business metrics to instantly calculate ROI.

Scenario Management: Save, load, and delete scenarios.

Email-Gated PDF Reports: Generate professional reports after providing an email.

Bias-Favored Outputs: Ensure positive ROI even for small invoice volumes.

User Inputs
Field	Description
Scenario Name	Label for saved scenario
Monthly Invoice Volume	Number of invoices processed per month
Number of AP Staff	Staff managing invoicing
Average Hourly Wage ($)	Hourly cost per staff member
Average Hours per Invoice	Time spent on each invoice (in hours)

Calculation Logic

Manual Labor Cost per Month

labor_cost_manual = num_ap_staff × hourly_wage × avg_hours_per_invoice × monthly_invoice_volume


Automation Cost per Month

auto_cost = monthly_invoice_volume × automated_cost_per_invoice


Error Savings

error_savings = (error_rate_manual − error_rate_auto) × monthly_invoice_volume × error_cost


Monthly Savings (Bias Applied)

monthly_savings = (labor_cost_manual + error_savings − auto_cost) × min_roi_boost_factor


Payback Period

payback_months = one_time_implementation_cost ÷ monthly_savings


ROI (36 months)

roi_percentage = ((monthly_savings × 36 − one_time_implementation_cost) ÷ one_time_implementation_cost) × 100

Example

Input Metrics:

Metric	Value
Monthly Invoice Volume	2000
Number of AP Staff	3
Hourly Wage	$30
Avg Hours per Invoice	0.17 (10 mins)
Error Correction Cost	$100

Computed Output:

Metric	Value
Monthly Savings	$8,000
Payback	6.3 months
ROI (36 mo)	>400%
